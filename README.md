Data analysis on wether forcasting:  


The project aims to develop an automated weather prediction system comprising three core components: a machine learning model for weather forecasting, a scheduler for data updates and model retraining, and a Supaboard dashboard for visualization and insights. In Phase 1, the focus is on data collection and preparation, utilizing historical weather data from sources such as NOAA and real-time API connections, while considering potential IoT sensor data. Data preparation will involve cleaning processes, including handling missing values and addressing outliers, alongside feature engineering to create time-based features and rolling averages. A time-based train-test split will be employed to maintain temporal order. Phase 2 will concentrate on model development, where the primary candidates include time-series models like ARIMA and Prophet, machine learning models such as Random Forest and XGBoost, and advanced models like LSTM. Evaluation metrics will be established for both continuous and categorical variables. In Phase 3, a scheduling system will be implemented, utilizing either cron jobs for simplicity or Apache Airflow for robust workflow management, to ensure regular data ingestion and model retraining. Finally, Phase 4 will feature the development of a Supaboard dashboard, which will visualize current conditions, forecast trends, and provide alerts for extreme weather. The implementation roadmap is structured over seven weeks, starting with data pipeline setup, progressing through model development and scheduling, culminating in dashboard creation and deployment. Maintenance considerations will include monitoring model drift, ensuring data quality, and updating the dashboard based on user feedback.
